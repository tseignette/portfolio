# Portfolio

My portfolio available on [tseignette.github.io]().

## Getting started
- `npm start` to start the project locally on [http://localhost:4200]() (accessible through local network)
- `npm run start:en` does the same using the English locale
- `npm lint` to lint (the default configuration has not been modified)
- `npm run extract` to extract the source language file in `src/locale`
- `npm run build` to build for production, files are generated in `dist/portfolio/browser`
- `npm run prerender` does the same but it also prerenders routes defined in the `prerender` configuration in `angular.json`
